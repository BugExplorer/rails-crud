Rails CRUD app
----------------------
(https://boiling-gorge-6222.herokuapp.com/)

This is a classic CRUD app created by the REST architecture.

Here you can add/read/update/delete articles and posts + images and comments.

In this project I've used nice features, like Postgres hashes and arrays.
Also STI, polymorphic associations, carrierwave, etc.

` Don't forget to configure db (PostgreSQL)`

Before you start, you can run
`rake populate:tags`

`rake populate:articles`

`rake populate:posts`
